# fun 
A C++14 header-based library for functional programming.

This library provides a set of [Haskell-like](http://www.haskell.org) functional programming tools. Thanks to template metaprogramming, the evaluation of such functions is lazy, so it is possible to deal with infinite lists. Furthermore, polimorphic functions can be used as parameters. This requires the use of several features of C++14, which are supported only in modern compilers.

As it is shown in the examples, the performance is very close to (sometimes even better than) basic C++ implementations of the same functions.

## What this library does not do
As oposed to Haskell, this library does not do:
* Pattern matching
* Full type checking (we would need [concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concepts_%28C%2B%2B%29) for that. Right now type error report consists of:
    * Huge unreadable C++ template errors.
    * Some static asserts here and there for better error reporting. 
* Lazy evaluation of everything (just of the lists that are returned by our implemented functions)

## Compiling the examples
There are several examples:
* [fun-dot](examples/fun-dot.cc) computes the dot product of two vectors represented by very large `std::list<double>`. It compares the performance of three different implementations of such dot product, including a basic C++ loop, C++ function based on the 'fun' library and a pure `fun`-generated function.
* [fun-norm](examples/fun-norm.cc) computes the *i-esm* norm.
* [fun-primes](examples/fun-primes.cc) creates an infinite list of prime numbers and prints part of it using different strategies (`take` and `takeWhile`).
* Go to the [examples](examples) directory to find more.

You can clone the repository and compile some of the examples (git + gcc) as follows:
```
git clone https://github.com/adolfomunoz/fun.git
g++ --std=c++14 -O3 fun/examples/fun-dot.cc    -o fun-dot
g++ --std=c++14 -O3 fun/examples/fun-norm.cc   -o fun-norm
g++ --std=c++14 -O3 fun/examples/fun-primes.cc -o fun-primes
```

There is also a `CMakeLists.txt` if you'd rather use [cmake](https://cmake.org/).

The `-O3` option is recommended for ensuring comparable performance with respect to non-functional approaches to solving the same problems. There is no further dependency apart from a C++14 capable compiler. It has been tested with:
* clang 3.5 and clang 3.6. There is a weird runtime bug with clang 3.8 that he have not been able to overcome.
* gcc 4.9.2 and later (and the MinGW64 counterpart)

## Usage
The library is thought as a Haskell clone, focusing on higher order list functions such as `map`, `filter`, `repeat`, `iterate`... 

It enables awesome one-liners such as
```
auto primes = fun::filter(
	[] (unsigned long n) { return !fun::any((_==0) * (n % _), fun::range(2,1+int(sqrt(n)))); },
	fun::range(1));
```
which is an infinite list of prime numbers, or
```
auto dot = fun::compose(fun::sum, fun::curry(fun::zipWith, _*_));
```
which is a function that calculates the dot product of two vectors (represented as lists or generally speaking anything iterable).

## Documentation
This library is still a work in progress, and its documentation is therefore a work in progress over a work in progress (meaning it is incomplete). As time passes the [doc](doc) folder will be filled.

Right now you can find information and examples of:
* [Functions](doc/functions.md): ways of combining and generating new functions, such as sections, currying or function composition.
* [Function generators](doc/function_generators.md): functions that generate other functions, such as `flip` or `uncurry`.
* [Higher order list functions](doc/higher_order.md), such as `map`, `filter` or `zipWith`

## Comparison with other functional libraries

There are other open source libraries that focus on functional programming:
* [FTL](https://github.com/beark/ftl) - Awesome library that accounts fur sum types, pattern matching and monad-like structures (none of those are done by our library). As this `fun` library, it is also able to curry functions.
* [fpcpp](https://github.com/jdduke/fpcpp) - Another awesome library. It is actually very similar to `fun`, and it is more developed. It is pre-C++14 so it has required a huge amount of extra work.
* [Boost Phoenix](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/phoenix/doc/html/) - A very stable functional programming library. It enables lazy function and value evaluation, and pre-C++11 lambda functions. It is rather extensive. I frankly did not find its syntax very appealing, but it seems very interesting to explore and research because it included functional programming in a pre-C++11 compiler.

Note that I have not tried any of these libraries extensively, so I might be wrong about something. Please let me know if this is the case, or if I have missed any important library.
